# React ToDo App 📝

## Project Overview

The **React ToDo App** is a simple and user-friendly task management application built using **React.js**. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed or pending, and delete tasks when they are no longer needed. The application uses the **localStorage** of the web browser to save the task list, ensuring persistence even after refreshing or reopening the browser.
